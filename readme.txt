Our Fully Functional Project is within the "Combined-Project" branch
which the link should redirect you to. Once here, download the ZIP folder
for this branch onto your device and unzip the folder.

Before running our program, ensure you have both node.js and mongodb
downloaded on your system, links are seen below:
Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en
Mongodb: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

Once downloaded, add both of these packages onto your environment variables path.

Within your terminal, navigate to the project directory. After which, install
our packages using the "npm install" command and then install nodemon
using command "npm install -g nodemon". This will allow you to run our program,
execute the "nodemon" command in your terminal and the server should boot up.

Once booted, in your prefered browser enter into the url bar "localhost:3000"
and this will route you to our websites login page. From here you can then create a 
new account or log into a preexisting account that you can then browse the functionalities
of our website. These include customizing playlists, user profile settings, listening to our
catalog of songs and testing your knowledge with quizzes cattering to certain genres or artists.
